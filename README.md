### In this project I've used the following.

- React Native
- TypeScript
- React Navigation
- Redux Toolkit (for Global State Management)
- React Hooks (for State Management)
- Axios for Networking Calls.

### Code Overview

There are following architecture I've used.

- **/app/common** => All the common Files which are most of the common are used throughtout the app
- **/app/config** => Redux Store Implementation
- **/app/features** => Complete Redux Toolkit Slices including Thunk Networking Call implementation
- **/app/interfaces** => All Innterfaces which are using in app.
- **/app/libs** => Some common files like as Common Colors, toast messages etc.
- **/app/navigation** => Complete navigation Stack are in this directry.
- **/app/networking** => All the Networking config
- **/app/screens** => All Screens like Splash Screen, Home Screen. Error handling and recent Screens are the part of Home Screen
- **/app/styles** => All styles files are here
- **/app/utils** => Some Utils files like as Common Methods, Conts, All Image Sources Files.

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# OR using Yarn
yarn install
This above command is used to install the node modules which are used in React Native App.
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
